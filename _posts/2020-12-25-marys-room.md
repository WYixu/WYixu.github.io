There is a thought experiment widely known as Mary’s Room. Mary was a brilliant scientist. However,
she had spent her whole life in a colorless room with a black-and-white television screen. But all
kinds of knowledge about color was accessible to her. For example, she knew that the world is consist
of three basic colors, and the color of sky is called “blue”, the color of grass is called “green”,
the color of apple is called “red”, and so on. She knew everything about color except their “color”.
The question is: if she went out room, would she learn anything new about color? In other words, are
there anything we can’t learn by just reading it?

This experiment was first devised by philosopher Frank Jackson. He came up with this experiment
(also known as the knowledge argument) to fight against physicalism, though he soon rejected this.
This question points to whether everything in the world can be described physically or not. For Western
academics, this seems worth arguing. But for most Chinese, we don’t believe it. Because in the ancient
Chinese philosophy book *Tao Te Ching*, Lao Tzu has already told us that “Tao” isn’t something that
can be described. And in Chinese culture, most people believe that teaching by words is much weaker
than teaching by actions, and there is always something that we cannot tell. This may be rooted in
Chinese people’s mind, so when I read about this thought experiment, my answer is that Mary definitely
learned something new. A simple similar situation is that you would never know the feeling of death
until you actually face it. So I think that Mary would learn something new.
